<h2>Hi, I'm Emma an american influencer, and this is my coffee brand : Chamberlain Coffee.</h2>
<p>
	Coffee for some people (aka me), it's more than a drink. It's a way to connect. It's a way to share moments. And, ok, sometimes it's just a way to wake up and get shit done.

	Ever since I was probably way to young to be drinking it, coffee has been a huge part of my life and routine. So much so that I want to share it with the world. But done in a way that I feel is right.

	So say hello to Chamberlain Coffee (my coffee!)
	I hope you like it.
